# AI_Final_Project
Abalone dataset. Classification: 'sex'
By: Mike Komor

The project was a very interesting one, I was able to follow the tutorial and apply the abalone  data set to achieve classification based on the target value of: "Sex". I found that using Random Forest Classifier gave me the best results in F1 and otherwise Logistic regression was best. Overall later on, tuned Logistic regression provided the best results, even in F1.
